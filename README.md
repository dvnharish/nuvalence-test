# Rectangles
## Problem: 
Given two rectangles, the program need to find if the two rectangles are ___Intersecting, Containing or Adjacent___ to each other

### Intersection: 
You must be able to determine whether two rectangles have one or more
intersecting lines and produce a result identifying the points of intersection.
### Containment: 
You must be able to determine whether a rectangle is wholly contained within
another rectangle.
### Adjacency: 
Implement the ability to detect whether two rectangles are adjacent. Adjacency is
defined as the sharing of at least one side. Side sharing may be proper, sub-line or partial. A
sub-line share is a share where one side of rectangle A is a line that exists as a set of points
wholly contained on some other side of rectangle B, where partial is one where some line
segment on a side of rectangle A exists as a set of points on some side of Rectangle B.


### Submission Must Include:

- An implementation of the rectangle entity as well as implementations for the algorithms that define the operations listed above.
- Appropriate documentation
- Test cases/unit tests
